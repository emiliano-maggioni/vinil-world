# Vinyl-world
A test E-commerce app done with ReactJS, Typescript, Material UI and much more...

## Project explanation
This is an app that allows you to choose and buy a vinyl, contains these pages:

- Home (where you can see all the items, search by name, order by price, add an item to cart and see the item details).<br />
- Cart (basically the cart, with a resume containing the cart info and the functionalities related to the cart).<br />
- Login (the login form).<br />
- Details (clicking on an album cover you can see this page that shows all the details about the record).<br />
<br />

This app uses css variables and functions like calc, flexbox, and css modules that avoid the risk to override classes (because every class has a unique name).
<br />
The markup is written in HTML5, the app is fully responsive, cross-browser and written mobile first.
<br />
Is an app built with Create react app and that uses the Hooks; i've used Material UI to build the form inputs and the notifications, Reack Hook form for the form managing and React router dom to manage the routing.
The state is managed by a context (the cart and the user session), with the help also of local storage to store the user email; the data comes from a .json file (only to avoid to be dependent on external public APIs that can expire)<br /><br />
